# Digital HMI scale with rfid tagging and sending data to thikspeak server.

Consists of a RPi running a fuzzy controller to regulate two processes one thermal and one pneumatic, both processes are controlled 
by pwm to their respective actuators, also an HMI interface is used to enter and vary the controller parameters, graphs in real time 
the variables and the data are saved in csv to be plotted and analyzed.

## Pre-requisitos üìã

1.Raspberry Pi 3B.
```
Any microcontroller that uses Python can be used, and the pin layout must be taken into account.
```

## Thermal controller
